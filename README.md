# ML_Assignment_1
This repository contains my solution of ML Assignment 1.  
It was about making predictions about perfomance in cloud gaming.
There were two tasks:
- __Regression task__ was about prediction of user's bitrate
- __Classification task__ was about classification of stream quality - is it good or bad.  
The whole pipeline is represented in Jupyter Notebook file (ML_Assignment_1.ipynb).
To properly run this file Python3 and common Data Analysis libraries (numpy, sklearn, pandas) are required.  
Report is represented in Report.pdf file.
